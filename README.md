- ðŸ‘‹ Hey!  
I'm Erik Redmo. An engineering student and aspiring full stack developer. In coding, I'm fluent in Python and learning Java at the moment. I learned Python on advanced level at university and Java is something I teach myself on my spare time. My primary interests and spare time activities besides programming include future agricultural challenges, ancient to modern history, geography, strategy games like Crusader Kings 3 and Civ 6, football, and a wide consumption of both music and movies. I'm currently in my Bachelor's in Global Systems Engineering, enjoying specialized courses like Climate Modelling, Evolution and Self-Organisation in Biological Systems, Mathematical Modelling and Problem-Solving, and Technical Systems in Society. My future hopes are to study more programming or some sort of data analytics or AI.   
Unfortunately, most of my work has been done through school and information regarding these are secret, but can be shown privately in an employment situation with aprovements from teachers. This information is merely to give a small presentation of me :)  
  
  Take care!
