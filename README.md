- ðŸ‘‹ Hey peeps!  
I'm Erik Redmo. An engineering student aspiring to become a back-end developer. In coding, I'm learning Python and Java at the moment, Python in school and Java on my spare time. My primary interests and spare time activities besides programming include future agricultural challenges, ancient to modern history, strategy games like Crusader Kings 3 and Civ 6, and a wide consumption of both music and movies. I'm currently in my Bachelor's in Global Systems Engineering, enjoying specialized courses like Climate Modelling, Evolution and Self-Organisation in Biological Systems, Mathematical Modelling and Problem-Solving, and Technical Systems in Society. My future hopes are to study more programming or some sort of data analytics or AI.   
I'm not currently looking for any side collaborations but please, reach out to me if you wish! This information is merely to give a small presentation of me :)  
  
  Take care!
